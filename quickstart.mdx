## Flexible Agent Infrastructure

Our vision is to empower everyone with a flexible, scalable agent infrastructure. We aim to support all types of agents, from web2 to web3, with a core foundation that allows easy customization using plugins.

With our community-driven marketplace, users can buy and sell new agent functionality. The marketplace offers a robust plugin ecosystem with a wide range of add-on functionalities, along with pre-built, specialized agents.

Every agent has base functionality serving as the core foundation. This base can be extended with plugins, allowing users to build highly customized and adaptable solutions tailored to their needs.

## Agents with wallets

A Solana and Ethereum wallet empowers agents to take action. Think of a wallet as the missing piece that transforms an agent from merely knowing what to do, to actually doing it. With wallets:

## Agent & Plugin Marketplace

Discover and monetize agents and plugins in Coffeeâ€™s decentralized marketplace. The marketplace offers:

* Pre-built agents ready to deploy for various use cases.

* A secure and transparent environment for buying and selling plugins.

* Opportunities for developers to showcase their creations and earn rewards.

## Making the complex simple

The future of UX(user experience) in the AI age is agentic. All industries are changing, but maybe none more than crypto. Complicated products like exchanges, bridges, and staking protocols are unusable to most - with agents, those products and functionality become as simple as sending a message to your agent.
