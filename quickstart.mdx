## Mission

<Info>
  Foster open-source, decentralized Agent infrastructure, enabling anyone to build and deploy on-chain agents.
</Info>

## Flexible Agent Infrastructure

#### How Agents Work

At their core, agents are AI-driven entities built to perform actions based on inputs. Here’s how they function:

* **Inputs**: Messages from users, blockchain transactions, or other data sources.

* **Actions**: Operations such as making trades, retrieving data, or forwarding messages.

* **Outputs**: Structured responses that guide what actions the agent will take and how they’ll execute them.

This structured approach ensures agents act precisely and efficiently.

## Agents with wallets

A Solana and Ethereum wallet empowers agents to take action. Think of a wallet as the missing piece that transforms an agent from merely knowing what to do, to actually doing it. With wallets:

* Agents can authenticate and access apps.

* Agents can interact and call other smart contracts, capable of performing any on-chain action.

* Agents can access and manage funds.

* Agents' actions can be stored on-chain with an extra layer of AI guardrails.

## Agent & Plugin Marketplace

Discover and monetize agents and plugins in Coffee’s decentralized marketplace. The marketplace offers:

* Pre-built agents ready to deploy for various use cases.

* Plugin hunctionality that can be added to new or existing agents

* A secure and transparent environment for buying and selling plugins.

* Opportunities for developers to showcase their creations and earn rewards.

## Making the complex simple

The future of UX(user experience) in the AI age is agentic. All industries are changing, but maybe none more than crypto. Complicated products like exchanges, bridges, and staking protocols are unusable to most - with agents, those products and functionality become as simple as sending a message to your agent.
