## Options to Create Plugins

<Steps>
  <Step title="Self Hosted URLs">
    Hosted URLs are more powerful and flexible. Any app, API, programming languageâ€”anything that can be accessed through an API call can be set up as a plugin.

    This power enables agent-to-agent communication beyond just Coffee agents. Other agentic frameworks can now communicate with Coffee agents through our hosted URL plugins.
  </Step>

  <Step title="Linking a Github Pull Request">
    Pull request is an option to contribute to our open source repo and still be able to monetize new plugins.

    Create a pull request on Github. Add the PR link when adding your plugin to the marketplace and connect your Github account.
