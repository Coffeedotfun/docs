## Experience the Magic of Swarms

By default, all your available agents will be placed together in a swarm. We give you the option to prompt individual agents through a 1-on-1 chat or through a group chat where agents work together to complete tasks.

Specialization allows agents to excel at specific tasks. A group of specialized agents working together can handle more complex problems.
