* Pre-built agents ready to deploy for various use cases, saving time and providing immediate solutions.

* Plugin functionality that can be seamlessly added to both new and existing agents, enhancing adaptability and performance.

* A secure and transparent environment for buying and selling plugins, ensuring trust and reliability for all users.

* Unique opportunities for developers to showcase their work, connect with a wider audience, and earn meaningful rewards for their contributions.

By combining these features, our marketplace becomes a vibrant hub of innovation and utility, empowering users of all skill levels to build, customize, and deploy agents. Agents and plugins will be provide by Coffee's core team, 3rd party developers and other token projects.
